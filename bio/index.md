    <h2>Calvin Grad</h2>
    <p>Calvin Grad is a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter born, 
    raised, and based in Brooklyn, NY. He has played drums, bass, and 
    guitar in various bands and has released three solo albums. He 
    has taught in classroom settings and privately since 2016. He 
    holds a bachelor's in music (Hunter College) and a masters in 
    music education (Brooklyn College).</p>

    <p>I offer lessons on drums, bass and guitar and teach a variety 
    of subjects and styles, from songwriting to music theory to 
    technique and more. I believe in utilizing a holistic approach 
    that centers around creating a curated musical world for each 
    student. Learning music should be a joyous process and should be 
    tailored to whatever you or your child are most interested in.</p>
