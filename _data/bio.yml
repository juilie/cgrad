  Calvin Grad is a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter born, 
  raised, and based in Brooklyn, NY. He has played drums, bass, and 
  guitar in various bands and has released three solo albums. He 
  has taught in classroom settings and privately since 2016. He 
  holds a bachelor's in music (Hunter College) and a masters in 
  music education (Brooklyn College).

  I offer lessons on drums, bass and guitar and teach a variety 
  of subjects and styles, from songwriting to music theory to 
  technique and more. I believe in utilizing a holistic approach 
  that centers around creating a curated musical world for each 
  student. Learning music should be a joyous process and should be 
  tailored to whatever you or your child are most interested in.
