  Calvin Grad is a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter born, 

  raised, and based in Brooklyn, NY. He has played drums, bass, and 

  guitar in various bands and has released three solo albums. He 

  has taught in classroom settings and privately since 2016. He 

  holds a bachelor's in music (Hunter College) and a masters in 

  music education (Brooklyn College).


  I offer lessons on drums, bass and guitar and teach a variety 

  of subjects and styles, from songwriting to music theory to 

  technique and more. I believe in utilizing a holistic approach 

  that centers around creating a curated musical world for each 

  student. Learning music should be a joyous process and should be 

  tailored to whatever you or your child are most interested in.

  *"Calvin is a wonderful teacher with a gift for making music understandable and fun. With his lessons my daughter as an 8th grade first year bass student was able to play jazz with high school students!"*


  *"﻿Calvin’s teaching style is the perfect combination of flexible and structured. He is genuinely curious about how I think about and feel music, and is eager to adapt our lessons accordingly. he also helps me stay engaged with guitar fundamentals and music theory.  Since starting lessons with Calvin, I’ve been writing new music more often and my singing has gotten noticeably more confident. Our lessons are often the highlight of my week, and I mean that sincerely. If you’re looking for a patient, enthusiastic, kind, and knowledgeable teacher, Calvin’s your guy."*


  *"Calvin is great at listening to what the student wants to learn and figuring out building blocks and foundations to help them reach their goals. He has such a broad range of skills and understands so many different genres of music that he’s able to draw on. Also, he has great hair!"*


  *"Calvin has been a great help in getting our son up to speed with his school jazz band. \[My son] Hendrix had zero experience when he came to Calvin, but is becoming a competent bass player in a short amount of time. We are thankful for all the time Calvin has put into making Hendrix a better player."*
